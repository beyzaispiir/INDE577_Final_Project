## Instructions for Reproducing Results

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-link>
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm's folder:
    ```bash
    cd Supervised_Learning/Perceptron
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file and run all cells sequentially.

4. Install required libraries if needed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

5. Follow instructions in each notebook to visualize results.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights
- All models implemented from scratch (no `sklearn` high-level functions used for model building unless otherwise allowed).
- Custom datasets prepared to avoid overlap with lecture datasets.
- Clear visualizations (scatter plots, decision boundaries, learning curves).
- Detailed residual analysis and result interpretation for each model.

---

## Notes
- README.md files included for each subfolder with description, dataset summary, and reproduction steps.
- Visualizations are carefully designed to support analysis (required for full credit).
- Documentation is complete and clear following the final project rubric.
