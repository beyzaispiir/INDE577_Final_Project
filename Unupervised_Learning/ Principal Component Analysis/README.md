ðŸ“š About PCA Algorithm
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps simplify complex datasets while keeping as much variation as possible.
It transforms the original features into a new set of features called principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables and captures a specific portion of the dataset's variance.
